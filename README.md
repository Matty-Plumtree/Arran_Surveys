All files here hold the code/data used in my Environmental Impact Assessment of the Lochranza area in the Isle of Arran, the structure follows:

- Abundance for simpson index.R : This code was used to calculate Simpson/Shannon indices for each location
- ArranExcel.xlsx : The data used is formatted with location data and the lowest taxonomic level possible
- Arran_Surveys.Rproj : Abbundance data for the south side site
- Beta diversity.R : Used to calculate the beta diversity of each study site
- GBIF ACTUAL.R : Code used to correct the naming of our species to those held with the GBIF taxonomy records
- Order presence.R : Used to visualise count data of each species within taxonomic groups
- Speceis Abundance North Inverts.R : Used to visualise North site invertebrate abundance
- Species Abundance South Inverts.R : Used to visualise South site invertebrate abundance
- Vertebrates presence.R : Visualise vertebrate abundance across both sites
